The long-standing continuation of these publications in the Group is a testament to the quality of our products and the strong connection we have built throughout the years with our readers, advertisers, communities and our employees.

Turnover for the publishing and printing segment fell 7.7% to US$193,957,000 from US$210,093,000 in the last year. Besides the decline in revenue, the result of this segment was also adversely affected by the aforementioned provisions.

The travel segment, on the other hand, achieved a 22.3% growth in turnover to US$91,603,000. As a result, the travel segment¡¯s profit before income tax surged 93.9% to US$4,579,000 from US$2,361,000 recorded in 2017/2018.

In the light of rapidly changing market conditions, the Group has continued its cost control efforts with a focus on improving the efficiency of printing processes, consolidation of common business functions, rationalisation of work space and redeployment of staff. At the same time, the Group has enhanced its editorial content and distribution channels in order to grow its audience base.
Furthermore, the Group has been developing new digital strategies which included offering new digital advertising solutions such as bespoke videos with interesting storylines . Cross platform marketing has also helped to improve the revenue of the digital operations which grew by about 10% for the financial year under review.
Our travel segment¡¯s performance was outstanding and very encouraging. It was driven mainly by increased demand for the segment¡¯s high quality, flexible and varied holiday packages.
The operating environment will remain challenging for the next financial year, and the trade tension between China and the US adds to the uncertainty in the world¡¯s economy.
Nevertheless, the Group will make every effort to improve its publishing and printing businesses, including taking necessary measures to reposition its products and prioritize the retraining of its employees to meet the rising demands of readers and advertisers.
Last year, the Group¡¯s editorial operations in Malaysia embarked on its ¡°Digital First¡± transformation program and a groundbreaking editorial system was rolled out in February 2019. This new editorial platform will enable a convergence of both its print and digital editorial operations, simplify the newsroom processes, and allow faster and more convenient ways for content to be shared and accessed through a single integrated platform at anytime and anywhere. At the same time, the Group will continue to improve on its digital solutions for advertisers.
Notwithstanding all the challenges it encounters, the Group will strive to further improve and strengthen its core businesses. In the next financial year, for its publishing and printing segment, the Group will do its best to deliver content that meets the demands of its readers and introduce new advertising solutions by leveraging on all its channels of delivery to improve the reach of its advertisers. In Malaysia, the Group will focus on developing and enhancing its digital content with its newly acquired editorial software. It will collaborate with professional producers to produce more attractive and entertaining videos. For the travel segment, the Group intends to offer a broader range of unique and exclusive tour packages to sustain its revenue growth.
We recognize the importance of innovation and technology on the Group¡¯s businesses. The Group sees the urgent need to stay ahead of the curve in the face of new technological advancements. As such, the Group is looking into ways to diversify its revenue stream by investing in new technology ventures and start-ups. These investments can span from publications, finance-related projects, e-commerce, renewable energy supply and other non-publication related activities. In addition, the Group will look for opportunities to unlock the value of its real estate assets. We hope these diversification initiatives will provide growth opportunities for the Group and reduce its reliance on its current core businesses over time.
The Board is committed to practising high standards of corporate governance and integrating sustainability measures into its operations throughout the Group. Details of our corporate governance initiatives, risk management, internal control policies and sustainability efforts are set out in the relevant sections of this Annual Report.

The slight improvement was mainly attributable to the travel segment which achieved a 22.3% growth in revenue to US$91,603,000 from last year¡¯s US$74,870,000. On the other hand, revenue from the Group¡¯s publishing and printing segment fell 7.7% year-on-year from last year¡¯s US$210,093,000 to US$193,957,000.
The Group reported a loss before income tax of US$6,537,000 for the year 2018/2019, compared with a loss before income tax of US$6,874,000 for 2017/2018.

The Group¡¯s profit before income tax and the above mentioned provisions was US$11,440,000, 39.7% below last year¡¯s comparative of US$18,981,000.

Publishing and printingMalaysia and other Southeast Asian countriesIn Malaysia, according to Nielsen, advertisement expenditure adex reached RM5.6 billion in FY2018/2019, mainly driven by increased spending by government ministries and agencies and political parties. While adex on traditional media dropped 10.2% compared to FY2017/2018, some of this decline can be attributed to the shift towards digital advertising.
For the year under review, adex for Chinese newspapers accounted for about 34.9% of the total adex for newspapers in Malaysia and the Group¡¯s four newspapers took up about 70.7% of the total adex for Chinese newspapers.
Turnover from Malaysia for the year ended 31 March 2019 declined by 9.1% to US$129,906,000 from US$142,848,000 in the previous year. This was mainly attributed to the decrease in advertising revenue, which was partly offset by increased revenue from the segment¡¯s digital business. In addition, the increase in the cover price of the Group¡¯s four newspapers in Malaysia since March 2018 has also contributed positively to this segment¡¯s turnover. The segment reported a loss before income tax of US$2,215,000, compared to last year¡¯s loss before income tax of US$2,959,000. This was due to the provisions for impairment of goodwill and certain plant and machinery totalling US$17,977,000 2017/2018: US$25,855,000. The segment¡¯s profit before income tax and the aforesaid provisions was US$15,762,000, 31.2% below last year¡¯s comparative of US$22,896,000. The decrease in the segment¡¯s operating results was mainly due to the decline in advertising revenue, which was partly offset by the increase in digital business revenue and cost savings.
The Group is the leading Chinese media group in Malaysia with 4 major daily newspapers and a suite of magazine titles. According to the latest data from Audit Bureau of Circulation Malaysia, the Group leads the Chinese newspaper industry with 82.2% of the total average daily print and digital replica circulation sales copies of Chinese language newspapers in Malaysia.

The Group is aware of the importance of the need for a robust and efficient editorial workflow and platform. Hence, in line with its ¡°Digital First¡± campaign, Sin Chew Daily announced its launch of a ¡°merged media system¡± which was adopted by its editorial department in February 2019. This new editorial system was launched together with a brand new online portal and mobile app. With the new system, its journalists can release news and visuals immediately wherever they are through the use of their mobile phones. This enables content to be reviewed and released to various portals in the fastest time frame. The new system will lead to a total transformation of the current editorial team to enable them to generate different kinds of content to cater for various platforms. The launch of this new editorial system will help publish content that will attract young readers whilst at the same time retain all existing and potential groups of readers and advertisers. The Group also hopes to benefit from monetising the syndication and cross-promotion of the content it produces and distributes.
The Group will continue to pursue new cost management methods, including reorganising and retraining employees to maximise operational efficiency in both print and digital operations.

Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mainland ChinaHong Kong¡¯s GDP growth slowed to 3.0% in 2018 compared to 3.8% in 2017 amid a slowdown in private consumption and fixed investment. Hong Kong¡¯s retail sales recorded a first-time decline of 10.5% in 24 months in February 2019 and total retail sales for the first quarter of 2019 was estimated to drop by 1.2% year-on-year. This reflected a cautious consumer sentiment weighed down by various external uncertainties, including the unsettling trade tension between China and the USA which affected China¡¯s economy and consumers¡¯ spending power.
The slower economic growth has contributed to a decline in the Group¡¯s revenue from this segment. Operations in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Mainland China recorded a total turnover of US$50,654,000 for the year ended 31 March 2019, a 1.8% decline from the previous year¡¯s US$51,583,000. The segment¡¯s loss before income tax widened to US$3,394,000 from last year¡¯s US$585,000, mainly due to the decline in revenue and the inclusion in last year¡¯s result a gain on deemed disposal of interest in an associate of US$2,716,000.
2018 marked the 40th anniversary of China¡¯s reform and opening-up, on which Ming Pao Daily News ¡°Ming Pao¡± published a series of in-depth reports analysing their origin, significance and influence. During the year, Ming Pao also launched special supplements to report on the opening of the West Kowloon High Speed Rail Station and the launch of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Development Plan. The reports provided in-depth analysis, from political, economic and social perspectives, the impacts and opportunities brought about by these new initiatives to Hong Kong. Furthermore, the new ¡°Discover Hong Kong¡± supplement gave readers a better understanding of Hong Kong and its people. The newspaper¡¯s culture section also underwent a revamp with new features on philosophy, history, and technology.
Ming Pao won 14 awards, including the coveted winner awards and first runner-up awards, in the ¡°Hong Kong News Awards 2018¡± organised by The Newspaper Society of Hong Kong.
The Group¡¯s business in educational textbooks publishing has been making steady progress and is expected to see further revenue growth and margin improvement through increasing its publications and collaboration with the Group¡¯s other publications.
One Media Group, the Group¡¯s listed subsidiary providing Chinese language lifestyle publications and outdoor media services in the Greater China region, reported a turnover of US$12,632,000 for the year ended 31 March 2019, representing a year-on-year decline of about 1.4%. The decrease in revenue was due primarily to the cessation of One Media Group¡¯s operations in Mainland China since July 2018. Revenue from One Media Group¡¯s Hong Kong and Taiwan segment reported a 3.4% growth, mainly attributed to the increase in its digital business revenue from video production, social media and websites. Driven by revenue growth and cost savings, One Media Group¡¯s operating results have improved and it reported a profit in the second half-year. It also managed to reduce its loss before income tax for the year to US$1,517,000 from last year¡¯s US$2,603,000.
North AmericaNorth America¡¯s publishing and printing operations recorded a decline in turnover of 14.5% to US$13,397,000 as against last year¡¯s US$15,662,000. The Group¡¯s business in this segment was negatively impacted by Canada¡¯s slowing economy and weakening property market as well as competition from other digital media. Furthermore, the Group ceased its operations in New York since November 2018. Despite a double-digit drop in revenue, this segment¡¯s loss narrowed by 10.5% from US$2,533,000 to US$2,267,000, driven mainly by cost savings gained through greater efficiencies and productivity.

Turnover and profit before income tax for the year were US$91,603,000 and US$4,579,000, compared to US$74,870,000 and US$2,361,000 in the last year respectively. The improved performance was mainly attributed to increased demand for the segment¡¯s luxury tour packages, especially to destinations in China and Europe.
Digital businessThe Group continued to expand and create new digital products, and the latest offering was the production of video content with interesting storylines. The Group worked with professional writers to create unique scripts and storylines for its advertisers.
The operation in Malaysia benefited from the Group¡¯s convergence strategy in which advertisers were offered a combination of print, digital and ground events to reach out to their target audience. The results have been encouraging.
The Group has been achieving higher traffic across the websites and apps of Sin Chew Daily and China Press as well as continually gaining momentum on other digital platforms including its social media sites. Sin Chew Daily and China Press continued to draw the highest unique visitors and most page views among the Group¡¯s publications. In the last month of FY2018/2019, Guang Ming Daily¡¯s website, guangming.com.my, saw its unique visitors grow more than 100%.
Furthermore, the Group¡¯s 4 newspapers and Pocketimes achieved an average growth of 100% in page views year-on-year supported by strong double digit growth in unique visitors.

During the current financial year, Ming Pao¡¯s main website, mingpao.com, as well as its major web properties including news.mingpao.com, ol.mingpao.com and mpfinance.com underwent layout and content enhancement as well as search engine optimisation in order to provide a better experience for their visitors and to drive more traffic and revenue. In addition, the related apps were upgraded so as to give readers a smoother and better reading experience and to increase the newspaper¡¯s penetration in the mobile market.

oUtLooKThe Group expects the operating environment for the next financial year to remain challenging. The unsettling trade tension between China and the USA adds to the uncertainty of the global economy and may have an adverse impact on the Group¡¯s performance for the coming year.
Notwithstanding the challenges, the Group will continue to remain focused on growing its core businesses while seeking growth opportunities in new markets and channels.
For its publishing business, it will continue to work on improving its content to meet the demands of its readers and devising new advertising options for its advertisers. Furthermore, it will continue its efforts in driving cost efficiency whilst leveraging on technology to further develop and enhance its digital content and platform capabilities. A positive note is that the newsprint price is softening which will help reduce the Group¡¯s production costs.
For the travel segment, through its expertise and worldwide travel network, the Group will continue to develop and offer interesting and tailor-made tour packages that provide customers with exclusive travel experiences.

This report is for the financial year 2018/19. All data and activities reported are in relation to the Group¡¯s business operations from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2019. This report is produced in accordance with Paragraph 29, Part A of Appendix 9C of the Main Market Listing Requirements of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad and in accordance with the Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting Guide as set out in Appendix 27 of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. The Group is also guided by the core principles of the Global Reporting Initiative ¡°GRI¡± Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. The Company has used as guidance the sections in the GRI Standards which are relevant to energy, emission, employment, training and education, and diversity. There is no external assurance for this report.
This sustainability report covers the Group¡¯s printing and publishing and travel operations in Malaysia and Hong Kong as these operations represent the core business of the Group and account for over 80% of its turnover for the financial year ended 31 March 2019.
As a trusted organisation having publications over 90 years, the Group has been communicating and reaching out to its stakeholders either formally or informally to build and strengthen its relationship with its stakeholders. Through these engagements, the Group hopes to understand their concerns on sustainability development, balancing their views and managing their expectations so as to ensure the long term and continuing success of the Group.
The Group has engaged its external stakeholders in identifying the Group¡¯s key EESG matters. The Group will select sustainability matters which have a material impact on the performance and sustainability of the Group.
Internal stakeholders have also been invited to continuously review their daily activities and processes in order to identify such material sustainability matters. Feedback from the internal stakeholders was checked against the following to determine materiality:
risk	aspects	by	reviewing	the	Group¡¯s	risk	registers;impact	on	the	Group¡¯s	business,	operations	and	reputation;impact	on	the	Group¡¯s	financial	aspect.
The Group has not referred to the relevant GRI Standards as guidance for benchmarking purpose.
enVIRonMentALThe Group has an Environmental Policy which aims to reduce the environmental impact of its business operations through conservation of energy, and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and waste. The environmental management strategy of the Group focuses on management of resources in its business operations and ensures that all aspects of its operations conform to sound environmental practices.
The environmental aspect includes the use of resources such as electricity and water; consumption of materials such as paper, plates, ink and other chemicals; and waste management which includes the disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and greenhouse gas emissions.
energyMost of the Group¡¯s electricity consumption comes from the production process in its printing plants. This is followed by electricity usage in its offices. The Group purchases electricity from energy service providers in Malaysia and Hong Kong. Being well aware that improving electricity usage efficiency is essential for reducing electricity consumption at its printing plants and offices, the Group has implemented measures to achieve the same.
Some of these initiatives include conducting energy-saving campaigns at its offices and printing plants where employees are reminded to switch off the lights and equipments when not in use. The production process is constantly reviewed in order to minimise the printing slots. The Group will continue to explore the possibility of further rationalisation to reduce the number of printing plants. These measures help the Group maintain acceptable electricity usage levels.
For the financial year ended 31 March 2019, the Group¡¯s electricity consumption was reduced by 7.9% year-on-year to approximately 20,153,000 kWh, mainly driven by the rationalisation of plants and efforts to conserve energy.
MEDIA CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED MALAYSIA COMPANY NO. 995098-A
The Group¡¯s water usage is predominantly for its printing plant production process. This is then followed by office usage. The Group strives to reduce its usage of this key resource to save costs and reduce its environmental impact. To this end, some plants in Malaysia have installed facilities to harvest and store rainwater for cleaning purpose.
The Group¡¯s water usage for the financial year ended 31 March 2019 was approximately 67,300 m3, 7.7% down from the previous year. Similar to electricity, the usage of water has also been on a reducing trend, mainly due to savings from the production process.
The Group places importance on ensuring that its waste materials are disposed of in a responsible manner. Wastes that are recyclable are sold to recycling companies whilst hazardous waste are disposed of by licensed contractors.
Solid wasteThe Group recycles its solid waste as much as possible. Waste materials such as used newsprint and plates are disposed of for recycling purposes. The newsprint wastage for the financial year under review amounted to approximately 2,508,000 kg.
Hazardous/scheduled wasteHazardous or scheduled waste generated from the Group¡¯s printing operations includes items such as contaminated rags, waste ink, and chemical waste. In Malaysia, this hazardous or scheduled waste is required to be collected and disposed of by licensed contractors of the Department of Environment. Similar regulations are enforced by the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department. To ensure the compliance with relevant regulations, all chemical wastes generated from production plants are collected and disposed of by licensed collectors. The scheduled waste are also stored in separate holding areas.
Effluents treatmentThe Group has installed wastewater treatment facilities at some of its printing plants to treat certain chemical waste before it is released back into the environment. Sampling and monitoring of the discharge are performed periodically to ensure that it is safe to be discharged into the drainage system.
The Group is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and minimising the environmental impact of its operations.
The Group has chosen its approach to report utility data from operations under its direct control in Malaysia and Hong Kong. Scope 2 Electricity is reported on below.
The Group uses the emission factor based on the 2007 report by Pusat Tenaga Malaysia titled ¡°Study on grid connected electricity baselines¡± in Malaysia and ¡°Emission Factor Electricity¡± supplied by Hong Kong Electric to identify its greenhouse gas emissions from purchased electricity.
The Group¡¯s CO2 emission from purchased electricity reduced by 7.9% in 2018/19 to approximately 14,100 tonnes from approximately 15,300 tonnes in 2017/18.
The Group does not report emissions from Scope 3, as it does not own a vehicle fleet. Products transportation has been outsourced.
MEDIA CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED MALAYSIA COMPANY NO. 995098-A
In order to reduce production costs, the Group places importance on materials management. The Group¡¯s production team constantly reviews the manner in which the materials are used and explore new technologies to further reduce their usage. In addition, the Group meticulously measures material consumption at its printing plants to ensure that all materials are used effectively and efficiently.
PaperNewsprint cost is one of the Group¡¯s main expenses. Hence, the Group monitors the use of newsprint prudently. Most of the Group¡¯s newsprint is made of environmentally friendly recycled paper. The Group has moved to use 27¡± newsprint web width to achieve higher efficiency. In addition, printing machines are constantly kept in good condition to prevent multiple starts and stops as these increase start-up waste. The Group also seeks to reduce press run wastage by setting key performance indicators to monitor paper waste continuously.
For the financial year ended 31 March 2019, the newsprint yield calculated as number of printed pages per kilogram of newsprint achieved by the Group was 226.
PlatesThe Group seeks to minimise the usage of plates. Its initiatives include reminding its editorial teams to avoid mistakes, thus reducing the number of plate changes.

MEDIA CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED MALAYSIA COMPANY NO. 995098-A
The Board acknowledges the importance of boardroom diversity and has adopted a policy on board diversity ¡°Board Diversity Policy¡±. Despite no specific targets being set, the Board is committed to improving the boardroom diversity in terms of gender, age, nationality, ethnicity and socio-economic background. In addition, the Nomination Committee also places emphasis on relevant skills, age, experience, knowledge, cultural background, personality and gender when considering new appointments of directors and conducting the annual performance evaluation on the effectiveness of the Board.
At present, the Company has one female director and the Board will work towards having more women representative on the Board to reflect the Company¡¯s commitment towards gender diversity. The Board will also take steps to nurture suitable and potential candidates in meeting the future needs of the Company.
The Nomination Committee established by the Board is responsible for assessing the nominees for directorship and Board committee membership and thereupon submitting their recommendation to the Board for decisions. In ensuring the suitability of a candidate, the Board reviews the required mix of skills, experience and expertise of Board members to ensure that it is sufficient to address the issues affecting the Company. In its deliberations, the integrity, professionalism, skills, knowledge, expertise, experience and independence of the proposed candidate are taken into account.
The Board may utilise independent sources to identify candidates for appointment of directors. Apart from that, the Nomination Committee also considers recommendations from existing Board members, management or major shareholders.
In accordance with the Company¡¯s Bye-Laws, all newly appointed directors shall retire from office but shall be eligible for re-election in the next AGM or the next general meeting subsequent to their appointment. The Company¡¯s Bye-Laws further provide that at least one third of the remaining directors save for the Non-executive Chairman for the time being are required to retire by rotation at each AGM and eligible for re-election. Further, in accordance with the HK Listing Rules, all directors including the Non-executive Chairman shall retire from office once in every 3 years but shall be eligible for re-election.
The Company had entered into appointment letters with the INEDs namely, Mr YU Hon To, David, Datuk CHONG Kee Yuon and Mr KHOO Kar Khoon, and the NED namely, Dato¡¯ Sri Dr TIONG Ik King, for a term of two years from 1 April 2018 to 31 March 2020, subject to retirement and re-election by rotation at the AGM in accordance with the Bye-Laws of the Company.
The Company measures the independence of its directors based on the criteria of independence as prescribed by the Bursa Securities Listing Requirements and the HK Listing Rules.
The Nomination Committee reviews the independence of the directors annually and each INED also performs a self-evaluation to affirm their independence from management. The Board and the Nomination Committee have, upon their annual assessment concluded that each INED continues to demonstrate conduct and behaviour that are essential indicators of independence and acts in the best interest of the Company. These were based on the grounds that they have consistently challenged management in an effective and constructive manner besides actively participated in Board discussion and provided an independent voice to the Board.
In line with the practice of the Malaysian Code, the tenure of an INED should not exceed a cumulative term of 9 years. An independent director may continue to serve the Board subject to his re-designation from an INED to a NED. In the event the Board intends to retain the INED after serving a cumulative term of 9 years, it should justify and seek annual shareholders¡¯ approval.
Mr YU Hon To, David was appointed to the Board as an INED on 30 March 1999, and has therefore served the Board for more than 9 years. During his tenure of office, Mr YU has fulfilled all the requirements regarding independence of an INED and has provided annual confirmation of independence to the Company pursuant to Rule 3.13 of the HK Listing Rules and Paragraph 1.01 of the Bursa Securities Listing Requirements.
The Board believes that Mr YU, who has over a period of time developed valuable insight of the Company and its business, can make valuable contributions to the Group. His expertise and experience enable him to discharge his duties and responsibilities independently and effectively notwithstanding his tenure on the Board. Based on the review and recommendation of the Nomination Committee, the Board views that Mr YU¡¯s independence has not been impaired or compromised in any way. In view of the above, the Board recommends to seek the shareholders¡¯ approval for the re-appointment of Mr YU as an INED of the Company at the forthcoming AGM. However, the shareholders¡¯ approval through a two-tier voting process to retain an independent director after the 12th year pursuant to the Malaysian Code is not applicable, as the tenure of Mr YU serving as an INED shall be counted and commenced from the date when the Company was dual-listed on Bursa Securities on 30 April 2008.
The Board, through the Nomination Committee, undertakes the annual evaluation on effectiveness of the Board as a whole, the Board committees and the contribution of each individual director of the Company based on a set of pre-determined criteria. During the year, the annual evaluation process was internally facilitated and conducted through questionnaires circulated to each individual director covering areas such as board structure, diversity including the gender diversity, contribution and performance, integrity and other qualities including core competencies which directors should bring to the Board, etc. They reviewed their own performance, the effectiveness of the Board, the Board committees and contributions of each individual director, the independence of the INEDs and the Board¡¯s mix and skillset. All INEDs had also submitted the annual confirmation of independence and confirmed their compliance with the independence criteria.
A summary report on the results of questionnaires was tabled to the Nomination Committee for deliberation, prior to recommending the appropriate action to the Board for consideration, in February 2019. The Nomination Committee is satisfied that i the Board and the Board committee¡¯s composition has fulfilled the criteria required, and possess a right blend of knowledge, experience and mix of skills; and ii the overall performance of the Board, Board committees and individual directors had been effective in discharging their functions and duties.

During the year under review, there was no change in the Company¡¯s Memorandum of Association and Bye-Laws.
This Corporate Governance Overview Statement was approved by the Board on 28 May 2019.
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the financial statements of the Company and of the Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance Cap. 622. The directors are also responsible for ensuring that the financial statements of the Company and of the Group are prepared with reasonable accuracy so as to give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company and of the Group as at 31 March 2019, and of the Group¡¯s profit or loss and cash flows for the year then ended.
prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis.
The directors are committed to taking reasonable steps in safeguarding the assets of the Company and of the Group, preventing and detecting fraud and other irregularities.
This Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control this ¡°Statement¡± is made pursuant to Paragraph 15.26b of the Bursa Securities Listing Requirements with reference to the Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control: Guidelines for Directors of Listed Issuers. It is also made in accordance with the Hong Kong Code contained in Appendix 14 of the HK Listing Rules. The Board remains committed to maintaining a sound risk management and internal control system to manage risks and safeguard shareholders¡¯ investments and the Group¡¯s assets.
The Board affirms its overall responsibility in establishing a sound risk management framework and internal control system for the Group as well as reviewing its adequacy and effectiveness. The Board is of the view that the risk management framework and internal control systems are designed to manage and mitigate the Group¡¯s risks within the acceptable risk parameters, rather than to eliminate all risks of failure to achieve business objectives.
In view of the inherent limitations in any system, such system can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatements, losses, frauds, breaches of laws and regulations, and unforeseen emerging risks.
The Group has established appropriate control structure and systematic process for identifying, evaluating, monitoring and managing significant risks pertinent to the achievement of its overall corporate objectives throughout the year. This process is regularly reviewed by the Board.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in i reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group¡¯s risk management and internal control systems; ii reviewing management¡¯s identification of the significant risks in accordance with the Group¡¯s risk management policy; and iii reporting to the Board of any significant failures or potential breaches of the Group¡¯s risk management policy.
The Group Executive Committee ensures on behalf of the Board that business risks are identified, assessed, managed and monitored across the businesses of the Group. The Group Executive Committee reports quarterly to the Board on changes in the risk landscape and developments in the management of principal risks.
The Group Executive Committee has established two separate Risk Management Committees ¡°RMC¡±, one in Malaysia and one in Hong Kong, to oversee and drive improvement in risk management.
The two RMCs are responsible for overseeing the implementation of the risk management framework, reviewing the risk management processes periodically and ensuring that on-going measures taken are adequate to manage, address or mitigate the risks identified.
The same principle applies to the Risk Management Units ¡°RMU¡±, where risk monitoring accountability rests with the respective subsidiaries within the Group. The RMU comprises key management staff from each division within the operating company.
MEDIA CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED MALAYSIA COMPANY NO. 995098-A
The risk management process is cascaded through the Group. All key management, heads of subsidiary companies and heads of departments have to identify, evaluate and manage risks associated with the business operations on an on-going basis with defined parameters, and record the identified risks in the risk registers. It is mandatory for this process to take place at least once a year.
For each risk identified, the management will assess the root causes, consequences and mitigating controls. An assessment is then made taking into account the probability of the risk occurring and the impact before and after mitigating controls. The content of the risk register is determined through review by the RMU and discussions with senior management.
At each RMU meeting, the overall risk profile of the operating company is assessed, significant risks are identified, the risk register is updated and action plans for mitigation are prepared. A risk assessment report comprising the action plans on significant risks is tabled to the RMC. The deliberation of risks and related mitigating responses are carried out at regular management meetings of the operating companies.
In essence, risks are dealt with and contained at the respective subsidiaries, and are communicated upwards to the Board via the RMC and the Group Executive Committee.
The Group Executive Committee is assisted by the Risk Coordinators RCs in Hong Kong and Malaysia, who act as the Group¡¯s focal points for all risk management activities within their respective regions.
The table below lists the principal risks and uncertainties that the Board considers relevant to the Group¡¯s business and highlights the mitigating actions that are being taken. However, this is not an exhaustive list of all relevant risks and uncertainties. Other factors besides those listed could also affect the Group and give rise to material consequences.
Macroeconomic riskIn the recent years, the Group has been adversely affected by weak economic conditions in the markets it operates in and has experienced declines in its print revenues.
If these conditions persist or worsen, the Group¡¯s business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be adversely affected.
Practicing	prudent	financial	management	and	efficient	operating	procedures.
Creating	products	which	meet	the	needs	of	customers.
Ensuring	cost	containment	and	efficiency	in	all	business	activities.
Closely	monitoring	economic	situation	and	forecasting	data	as	any	significant	or	sustained	rise	in	the	inflation rate may put pressure on interest rates and hence the Group¡¯s cost base.
Market disruptionMaintaining profitability is increasingly challenging for the Group¡¯s publishing business due to market disruption arising from the shift from print to digital and mobile media.
The increasing number of digital media options available is significantly expanding consumer choices and experiences, resulting in shifting audience preferences.
The Group¡¯s performance will be affected by its ability to respond timely to market changes and consumer preferences.
Developing	new	content,	products	and	services	that	appeal	to	customers.
Focusing	on	building	digital	audiences	and	revenue	through	new	platforms	and	enhancing	the	content	available to readers and advertisers.
Closely	monitoring	business	performance	through	financial	reporting	and	KPIs.
newsprint price and supply riskNewsprint cost represents a significant component of the Group¡¯s costs of sales for its print newspapers.
While the newsprint price is currently at a low level and that supply is stable, however, newsprint price has historically been volatile and may increase as a result of various factors.
A significant increase in the newsprint price and a shortage in supply could adversely impact the Group¡¯s operating results.
Closely	monitoring	print	consumption	and	efficient	management	of	content.
Business interruptionThe Group may experience a significant loss of production capability during a disaster scenario which could severely impact revenue and lead to increased costs.
Production	Recovery	Plans	and	IT	Disaster	Recovery	Plans	for	individual	business	units	where	appropriate.
Maintaining	adequate	IT	systems	to	secure	business	and	customer	data,	and	protect	from	deliberate	theft	of	sensitive information, loss of service and cybercrime.
A	crisis	management	framework	is	in	place	which	can	be	activated	in	the	event	of	a	crisis	or	disaster.
IT	standards	and	policies	are	in	line	with	appropriate	best	practices.
Regular	maintenance	of	press	and	critical	operating	systems.
non-compliance with laws and regulationsThe Group operates across a number of markets and jurisdictions which expose it to a range of legal, tax and other regulatory laws that must be complied with.
The Group¡¯s failure or inability to comply with laws and regulations in the markets in which it operates could have material adverse effects on the Group¡¯s business.
The Group is committed to adhering to all relevant laws and regulations in relation to its business activities.
A number of processes which involve the Group¡¯s company secretaries, legal and editorial departments are in place to assess and address any compliance requirements.
The mission of the Internal Audit Function is to enhance and protect organisational value of the Group by providing risk-based and objective assurance, advice and insight. The Internal Audit Function helps the Group accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, controls and governance processes.
The Internal Audit Function reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group¡¯s risk management and internal control systems based on its annual audit plan approved by the Audit Committee. This provides reasonable assurance to the Board that risk management and internal control processes are in place and operating satisfactorily. For any significant gaps identified, Internal Audit Function provides recommendations to management to improve the design, process and procedures where applicable.
The	Board	reviews	and	approves	the	Group¡¯s	annual	business	plans	and	budgets.	The	Group¡¯s	senior	management	meets	on	a	monthly	basis with operating companies¡¯ management to review their businesses and financial performances against the business plans and approved budgets. Key business risks relevant to each operating company are also reviewed in these meetings;
Explanations	on	actual	performance	and	significant	variances	against	budgets	are	provided	to	the	Board	on	a	quarterly	basis.	This	helps	the	Board and senior management monitor the Group¡¯s business operations and plan on a timely basis to suit the changes in business environment;
The	Group	maintains	appropriate	insurance	programmes	in	order	to	provide	sufficient	insurance	coverage	on	its	major	assets	and	against	libel suits that could result in material loss. The insurance brokers assist management in conducting a yearly risk assessment on the Group¡¯s operations, which helps the Group in assessing the adequacy of the insurance coverage;
The	legal	department	monitors	compliance	with	relevant	laws	and	regulations	which	govern	the	Group¡¯s	businesses.
The Group has a whistleblowing policy approved by the Board. The policy outlines the Group¡¯s commitment towards enabling its employees to raise concerns about possible improprieties in financial reporting, internal controls or other matters within the Group. Proper arrangements have been put in place for fair and independent investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow-up actions. All matters reported will be investigated and handled with strict confidentiality. The effectiveness of this policy is monitored and reviewed regularly by the Audit Committee.
The Board has reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group¡¯s risk management framework and internal control activities to ensure that necessary actions have been or are being taken to rectify inadequacy or weaknesses identified during the year.
The Board has also received reasonable assurance from the Group CEO and Head of Finance that the Group¡¯s system of risk management and internal control, in all material aspects, is operating adequately and effectively. For the financial year under review and up to the date of this Statement, there were no material control failures or adverse compliance events that have directly resulted in any material loss to the Group.
In this connection, the Board concludes that an effective system of risk management and internal control is in place to safeguard the shareholders¡¯ investment and the Group¡¯s assets.
The external auditor has reviewed this Statement for inclusion in the Group¡¯s Annual Report for the financial year ended 31 March 2019. The external auditor has reported to the Board that nothing has come to its attention that causes it to believe that this Statement is inconsistent with its understanding of the process adopted by the Board in reviewing the adequacy and integrity of the Group¡¯s system of risk management and internal control.
This Statement on Risk Management and Internal Control was approved by the Board on 28 May 2019.

the	notes	to	the	consolidated	financial	statements,	which	include	a	summary	of	significant	accounting	policies.
Our opinionIn	our	opinion,	the	consolidated	financial	statements	give	a	true	and	fair	view	of	the	consolidated	financial	position	of	the	Group	as	at	31	March	2019, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial	Reporting	Standards	¡°IFRSs¡±	and	have	been	properly	prepared	in	compliance	with	the	disclosure	requirements	of	the	Hong	Kong	Companies	Ordinance.
We	conducted	our	audit	in	accordance	with	International	Standards	on	Auditing	¡°ISAs¡±.	Our	responsibilities	under	those	standards	are	further	described	in	the	Auditor¡¯s	Responsibilities	for	the	Audit	of	the	Consolidated	Financial	Statements	section	of	our	report.
We	believe	that	the	audit	evidence	we	have	obtained	is	sufficient	and	appropriate	to	provide	a	basis	for	our	opinion.
IndependenceWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants¡¯ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants	¡°IESBA	Code¡±,	and	we	have	fulfilled	our	other	ethical	responsibilities	in	accordance	with	the	IESBA	Code.
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matter identified in our audit is related to Goodwill impairment assessment.
Comparing the key input data in management¡¯s DCF to the Board¡¯s approved budget and the business plan.
Assessing the methodology adopted and the mathematical accuracy of the underlying DCF calculations.
discount rates by comparing with the cost of capital of comparable companies with assistance of our own valuation specialists.
Based on the procedures performed, we found the key assumptions adopted and estimates made by management to be supportable based on the evidence we gathered.
As at 31 March 2019, the Group had goodwill with carrying amount of US$14,748,000, before impairment provision for current year, arising from the acquisition of certain equity interests of Sin Chew Media Corporation Berhad ¡°Sin Chew¡± in 2008. As required by IAS 36 ¡°Impairment of assets¡±, an impairment review is performed on goodwill at least annually or when there is an indicator of impairment.
In carrying out the impairment assessment of goodwill, management determined the recoverable amount based on the higher of fair value less cost of disposal ¡°FVLCD¡± and value-in-use ¡°VIU¡± calculations of the cash-generating unit ¡°CGU¡±. In the absence of a market comparable, management adopted the income approach and used discounted cash flow forecast ¡°DCF¡± to determine the recoverable amount of the CGU under both VIU and FVLCD methods and considered the recoverable amount under the VIU method to be higher.
Preparation of DCF required the use of many assumptions and management exercised significant judgements in determining these assumptions. Key assumptions adoption and judgements exercised in the preparation of the DCF included:
The recoverable amount of the CGU determined based on the DCF was lower than the carrying amount, and therefore, a further provision for impairment of US$14,748,000 was required to write down the above goodwill to zero as at 31 March 2019.
We focused on this area because of the significance of the balance and the significant judgements and assumptions involved in determining the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill is associated.

The directors of the Company are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises all of the information included in the annual report other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor¡¯s report thereon.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRSs and the disclosure requirements of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group¡¯s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group¡¯s financial reporting process.
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor¡¯s report that includes our opinion. We report our opinion solely to you, as a body, in accordance with Section 90 of the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or accept liability to any other person for the contents of this report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
Identify	and	assess	the	risks	of	material	misstatement	of	the	consolidated	financial	statements,	whether	due	to	fraud	or	error,	design	and	perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain	an	understanding	of	internal	control	relevant	to	the	audit	in	order	to	design	audit	procedures	that	are	appropriate	in	the	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group¡¯s internal control.
Evaluate	the	appropriateness	of	accounting	policies	used	and	the	reasonableness	of	accounting	estimates	and	related	disclosures	made	by	the directors.
Conclude	on	the	appropriateness	of	the	directors¡¯	use	of	the	going	concern	basis	of	accounting	and,	based	on	the	audit	evidence	obtained,	whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group¡¯s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor¡¯s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor¡¯s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
Evaluate	the	overall	presentation,	structure	and	content	of	the	consolidated	financial	statements,	including	the	disclosures,	and	whether	the	consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Obtain	sufficient	appropriate	audit	evidence	regarding	the	financial	information	of	the	entities	or	business	activities	within	the	Group	to	express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the audit committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the audit committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor¡¯s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor¡¯s report is Mr. WONG Ka Keung Johnny.

Media Chinese International Limited the ¡°Company¡± is a limited liability company incorporated in Bermuda. Its registered address is Canon¡¯s Court, 22 Victoria Street, Hamilton HM12, Bermuda.
The Company is an investment holding company. The principal activities of its subsidiaries are publishing, printing and distribution of newspapers, magazines, books and digital contents primarily in the Chinese language, and the provision of travel and travel related services in Hong Kong, Taiwan, North America, Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries. The shares of the Company have been listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited the ¡°HK Stock Exchange¡± since 22 March 1991 and subsequently dual-listed on Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad ¡°Bursa Securities¡± on 30 April 2008.
These consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars ¡°US$¡±, unless otherwise stated. These consolidated financial statements have been approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 28 May 2019.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries collectively the ¡°Group¡± have been prepared in accordance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards ¡°IFRSs¡± and under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment properties, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, which are carried at fair value.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group¡¯s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in Note 4.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 are disclosed in note 2.2 below. The other new standards did not have any material impact on the Group¡¯s accounting policies and did not require retrospective adjustments.
MEDIA CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED MALAYSIA COMPANY NO. 995098-A
IFRS 16 LeasesIFRS 16 was issued in January 2016. It will result in almost all major leases being recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed. Under the new standard, an asset the right to use the leased item and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised. The only exceptions are short-term and low-value leases. The accounting for lessors will not significantly change.
The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost and subsequently measured at cost subject to certain exceptions less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted for interest and lease payments, as well as the impact of lease modification, amongst others. Under IFRS 16, principal portion of lease payments in relation to lease liability will be presented as financing cash flows.
New and amended standards and interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group ContinuedIFRS 16 Leases ContinuedImpactAs at 31 March 2019, the Group had non-cancellable operating lease commitments of US$4,417,000. A preliminary assessment indicates that these arrangements will meet the definition of a lease under IFRS 16, and the Group will recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability in respect of all these leases unless they qualify for low value or short-term lease upon the application of IFRS 16. In addition, the application of these new requirements may result in changes to measurement, presentation and disclosures. The Group has assessed the impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 on the Group¡¯s results and it is expected that right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of these lease commitments will be required to be recognised in the Group¡¯s consolidated statement of financial position.
The Group will apply the standard from its mandatory adoption date of 1 January 2019. The Group intends to apply the simplified transition approach and will not restate comparative amounts for the year prior to first adoption.
There are no other new, amended or revised IFRSs and interpretations that are not yet effective and that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
This note explains the impact of the adoption of IFRS 9 ¡°Financial Instruments¡± and IFRS 15 ¡°Revenue from Contracts with Customers¡± on the Group¡¯s consolidated financial statements and also discloses the new accounting policies that have been applied from 1 April 2018, where they are different to those applied in the prior periods.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments ¡ª Impact of adoptionIFRS 9 replaces the provisions of IAS 39 that relate to the recognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, derecognition of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets and hedge accounting. IFRS 9 also significantly amends other standards dealing with financial instruments such as IFRS 7 ¡°Financial Instruments ¡ª Disclosures¡±.
The adoption of IFRS 9 from 1 April 2018 resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recognised in the Group¡¯s consolidated financial statements. The new accounting policies are set out in note 2.2ai, 2.2aii and 2.11a. In accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 9, comparative figures have not been restated. As a consequence, any adjustments to carrying amounts of financial assets or liabilities are recognised at the beginning of the current reporting period, with the differences recognised in opening retained earnings. Provision for impairment have not been restated in the comparative period.

Reclassification from AFs to FVtPLCertain investment in unlisted club debentures was reclassified from AFS to FVTPL US$96,000 as at 1 April 2018. They do not meet the IFRS 9 criteria for classification at amortised cost, because their cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest.
Reclassification from AFs to FVoCIThe Group elected to present in other comprehensive income ¡°OCI¡± changes in the fair value of certain equity investments previously classified as AFS, because these investments are held as long-term strategic investments that are not expected to be sold in the short to medium term. As a result, assets with a fair value of US$8,979,000 were reclassified from AFS to FVOCI and related fair value gains were reclassified from the AFS reserve to the FVOCI reserve on 1 April 2018.
other financial assetsOther listed equity securities that are held for trading are required to be classified as FVTPL under IFRS 9. There was no impact on the amounts recognised in relation to these assets from the adoption of IFRS 9.
The Group was required to revise its impairment methodology under IFRS 9 for the class of assets above.
From 1 April 2018, the Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
The Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measure ECLs which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the ECLs, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The Group applied different expected loss rates to different classes of trade receivables according to their respective risk characteristics and the days past due. Other financial assets at amortised cost include other receivables. The Group has applied the ECL model to other receivables as at 1 April 2018 and the change in impairment methodologies did not have any material impact on the Group¡¯s consolidated financial statements and the opening loss allowance is not restated in this respect.
While cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank_deposits are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, the identified impairment loss was immaterial.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers ¡ª Impact of adoptionThe Group has adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from 1 April 2018 which resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. In accordance with the transition provisions in IFRS 15, the Group has elected to use a modified retrospective approach for the transition which allows the Group to recognise the cumulative effects of initially applying IFRS 15 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as at 1 April 2018.
The accounting policies were changed to comply with IFRS 15, which replaces the provisions of IAS 18 Revenue and the related interpretations that relate to the recognition, classification and measurement of revenue and costs.
MEDIA CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED MALAYSIA COMPANY NO. 995098-A
Presentation of contract asset and contract liabilityReclassifications were made as at 1 April 2018 to be consistent with the terminology used under IFRS 15.
A contract asset represents the Group¡¯s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Group has transferred to a customer that is not yet unconditional. It is assessed for impairment in accordance with IFRS 9. In contrast, a receivable represents the Group¡¯s unconditional right to consideration, i.e. only the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due.
A contract liability represents the Group¡¯s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Group has received consideration or an amount of consideration is due from the customer.
The Group¡¯s contract liabilities represented payments received by the Group in advance for subscription of its publications and customer deposits received by its tour operations, which the Group will recognise as revenue when the publications are delivered and the travel services are provided to the customers. These were previously recorded as receipts in advance and were classified under ¡°trade and other payables¡±.
The adoption of IFRS 15 does not have a significant impact on how the Group recognises revenue and there is no impact of transition to IFRS 15 on the Group¡¯s retained earnings at 1 April 2018.
Accounting for publishing and printing businessIn prior reporting periods, the Group accounted for revenue from publishing and printing business when significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. There is a change in accounting policy upon adoption of IFRS 15.
Under IFRS 15, advertising income, net of trade discounts, is recognised over time when the newspapers and magazines are published.
Revenue from the circulation and subscription sales of newspapers, magazines and books, net of trade discounts and returns, is recognised at a point in time when control of goods is transferred to the customer, which generally coincides with the date of delivery. Unearned subscription fees received from subscribers are recorded as contract liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Accounting for travel and travel related servicesIn prior reporting periods, the Group accounted for revenue from tour operations based on the percentage of completion of the travel and travel related services rendered. There is a change in accounting policy upon adoption of IFRS 15.
Under IFRS 15, revenue for package tours is recognised over time in which the control of services is transferred to the customer as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit provided by the Group.
Revenue from the provision of ancillary travel related products and services, sales of air tickets, hotel accommodation and hotel packages is recognised at a point in time when the booking services or tickets are delivered to and have been accepted by the customers. The Group is the agent in these transactions and the revenue is recognised on a net basis.
ConsolidationA subsidiary is an entity including structured entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
Business combinationsThe Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Non- controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity¡¯s net assets in the event of liquidation are measured at either fair value or the present ownership interests¡¯ proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the acquiree¡¯s identifiable net assets. All other components of non-controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair values, unless another measurement basis is required by IFRS.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the carrying amount of the acquirer¡¯s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss.
MEDIA CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED MALAYSIA COMPANY NO. 995098-A
Business combinations ContinuedWhere settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the Group¡¯s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent lender under comparable terms and conditions.
Any contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are subsequently re-measured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill note 2.9. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and acquisition-date fair value of any previously held interest is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss.
Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Unrealised losses are also eliminated. When necessary, amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the Group¡¯s accounting policies.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries without change of controlTransactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions ¡ª that is, as transactions with the owners of the subsidiary in their capacity as owners. The difference between the fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying amount of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
Disposal of subsidiariesWhen the Group ceases to have control, any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss.
Separate financial statementsInvestments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment. Cost includes direct attributable costs of investment. The results of subsidiaries are accounted for by the Company on the basis of dividends received and receivable.
Impairment testing of the investments in subsidiaries is required upon receiving a dividend from these investments if the dividend exceeds the total comprehensive income of the subsidiary in the period the dividend is declared or if the carrying amount of the investment in the separate financial statements exceeds the carrying amount in the consolidated financial statements of the investee¡¯s net assets including goodwill.
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20% and 50% of the voting rights or board representation.
Investments in joint arrangements are reclassified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures.
Interests in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the interests are initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group¡¯s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses and movements in other comprehensive income. The Group¡¯s investment in joint ventures and associates include goodwill identified on acquisition. Upon the acquisition of the ownership interest in a joint venture or an associate, any difference between the cost of the joint venture and the Group¡¯s share of net fair value of the joint venture¡¯s or associate¡¯s identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted for as goodwill.
The Group¡¯s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, and its share of post-acquisition movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in other comprehensive income with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group¡¯s share of loss in a joint venture or associate equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture or associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
The carrying amount of equity-accounted investments is tested for impairment in accordance with the policy described in note 2.10.
Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and its joint ventures and associates are recognised in the Group¡¯s financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investors¡¯ interests in the joint ventures and associates. Unrealised losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of joint ventures and associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, who has been identified as the Group Executive Committee, is responsible for allocating resources, assessing performance of the operating segments and making strategic decisions.
Functional and presentation currencyItems included in the financial statements of each of the Group¡¯s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates, i.e. the functional currency. The functional currency of the Company is Malaysian Ringgit ¡°RM¡±. However, each entity within the Group can present its financial statements in any currency, which can be the same or different from the entity¡¯s functional currency. As the Group operates internationally, management considers that it is more appropriate to use US$, a globally recognised currency, as the presentation currency for the Group¡¯s consolidated financial statements. For the entity whose functional currency is not US$, its results and financial position have been translated into US$.
MEDIA CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED MALAYSIA COMPANY NO. 995098-A
Transactions and balancesForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings and cash and cash equivalents are presented in the consolidated statement of profit or loss within ¡®finance costs¡¯. All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the consolidated statement of profit or loss within ¡®Other gains/losses, net¡¯.
all resulting currency translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate. Currency translation differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Disposal of foreign operationOn the disposal of a foreign operation that is, a disposal of the Group¡¯s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of joint control over a joint venture that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation, all of the currency translation differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss.
In the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of accumulated currency translation differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in profit or loss. For all other partial disposals that is, reductions in the Group¡¯s ownership interest in joint ventures or associates that do not result in the Group losing significant influence or joint control, the proportionate share of the accumulated currency translation differences is reclassified to profit or loss.
Freehold land is not amortised. Buildings situated on freehold land are stated at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives to the Group. The principal annual rates used for this purpose range from 2% to 5%.
Buildings situated on leasehold land and held for own use are stated at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired periods of the leases or their expected useful lives to the Group, whichever is shorter. The principal annual rates used for this purpose range from 2% to 5%.
Leasehold land held for own use under a finance lease is stated at cost and amortised over the period of the lease on a straight-line basis.
Plant and equipment, comprising leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, office equipment, machinery, printing equipment and motor vehicles, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Construction in progress is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent costs are included in an asset¡¯s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss during the financial period in which they are incurred.
The assets¡¯ depreciation method, useful lives and residual values are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
An asset¡¯s carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset¡¯s carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount note 2.10.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within ¡°Other operating expenses¡± in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
MEDIA CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED MALAYSIA COMPANY NO. 995098-A
Investment propertyInvestment property, principally comprising leasehold land and buildings, is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and is not occupied by the Group. Land held under operating leases is accounted for as investment properties when the rest of the definition of an investment property is met. In such cases, the operating leases concerned are accounted for as if they were finance leases. Investment property is initially measured at cost, including related transaction costs and where applicable borrowing costs. After initial recognition, investment properties are carried at fair value, representing open market value determined at each reporting date by external valuers. Fair value is based on active market prices adjusted, if necessary, for any difference in the nature, location or condition of the specific asset. If the information is not available, the Group uses alternative valuation methods such as recent prices on less active markets or discounted cash flow projections. Changes in fair values are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as part of a valuation gain or loss in ¡°Other gains/losses, net¡±.
GoodwillGoodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash-generating units ¡°CGUs¡±, or groups of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the business combination. Each CGU or group of CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill is monitored at the operating segment level.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. The carrying amount of goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and is not subsequently reversed.
Other intangible assetsOther intangible assets primarily comprise costs of computer softwares, archives, mastheads, publishing rights and broadcast licence that are acquired by the Group and are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Assets that have an indefinite useful life, i.e. goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset¡¯s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset¡¯s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
those	to	be	measured	subsequently	at	fair	value	either	through	OCI,	or	through	profit	or	loss,	andthose	to	be	measured	at	amortised	cost.
The classification depends on the Group¡¯s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.
For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI.
For investments in debt instruments, this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held.
For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at FVOCI.
The Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.
Debt instrumentsSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group¡¯s business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt instruments:
Amortised	cost:	Assets	that	are	held	for	collection	of	contractual	cash	flows	where	those	cash	flows	represent	solely	payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other_income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in ¡°Other gains/losses, net¡± together with foreign exchange gains and losses. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.
MEDIA CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED MALAYSIA COMPANY NO. 995098-A
FVOCI:	Assets	that	are	held	for	collection	of	contractual	cash	flows	and	for	selling	the	financial	assets,	where	the	assets¡¯	cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Movements in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses which are recognised in profit or loss. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to profit or loss and recognised in ¡°Other gains/losses, net¡±. Interest income from these financial assets is included in other_income using the effective interest rate method. Foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in ¡°Other gains/losses, net¡± and impairment losses are presented as a separate line item in the statement of profit or loss.
FVTPL:	Assets	that	do	not	meet	the	criteria	for	amortised	cost	or	FVOCI	are	measured	at	FVTPL.	A	gain	or	loss	on	a	debt	investment that is subsequently measured at FVTPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented within ¡°Other gains/losses, net¡± in the period in which it arises.
Equity instrumentsThe Group subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where the Group¡¯s management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in OCI, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investments. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other_income when the Group¡¯s right to receive payments is established.
Changes in the fair value of FVTPL are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses on equity investments measured at FVTPL are not reported separately from other changes in fair value.
Recognition and derecognitionRegular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade-date ¡ª the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the assets. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets expire, or when the financial assets are transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets.
MeasurementAt initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVTPL are expensed in profit or loss.
ImpairmentFrom 1 April 2018, the Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.
For trade and other receivables, the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.
Accounting policies applied until 31 March 2018ClassificationThe Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income. The classification depends on the purposes for which the financial assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of the financial assets at initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or lossFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term. Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if expected to be settled within 12 months; otherwise, they are classified as non-current assets.
Loans and receivablesLoans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets, except for the amount that are settled or expected to be settled more than 12 months after the end of the reporting period. These are classified as non-current assets. The Group¡¯s loans and receivables comprise ¡°Trade and other receivables¡± Note 2.14, ¡°Short-term bank_deposits and cash and cash equivalents¡± Note 2.15 in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Available-for-sale financial assetsAvailable-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories. They are included in non-current assets unless the investment matures or management intends to dispose of it within 12 months of the end of each reporting period.
Recognition and measurementRegular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade-date ¡ª the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the assets. Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments expire, or when the financial assets are transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets. Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ¡°Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss¡± category are presented in the consolidated statement of profit or loss within ¡°Other gains/losses, net¡±.
Changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the consolidated statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty.
MEDIA CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED MALAYSIA COMPANY NO. 995098-A
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average method. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Trade and other receivables are amounts due from customers for merchandise sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection of trade and other receivables is expected in one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. See note 2.11a for a description of the Group¡¯s impairment policies.
In the consolidated statement of cash flows and consolidated statement of financial position, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, bank_deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
In the consolidated statement of financial position, short-term bank_deposits include bank_deposits with original maturities of more than three months.
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Trade payables are classified as current_liabilities if payment is due within one year or less or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current_liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the end of the reporting period.
General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
Current income taxThe current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of each reporting period in the countries where the Company, its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred income taxInside basis differencesDeferred income tax is recognised, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred income tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill; deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of each reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Outside basis differencesDeferred income tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements, except for deferred income tax liability where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Generally the Group is unable to control the reversal of the temporary difference for associates and joint arrangements. Only where there is an agreement in place that gives the Group the ability to control the reversal of the temporary difference is a deferred income tax liability not recognised.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised on deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements only to the extent that it is probable the temporary differences will reverse in the future and there is sufficient taxable profit available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
OffsettingDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax jurisdiction on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
2.21 employee benefitsPension obligationsGroup companies operate various pension schemes. These schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds and, where applicable, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit plans.
Defined contribution plansA defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate publicly or privately administered pension insurance plan on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions once the fixed contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available. The Group¡¯s defined contribution plans cover eligible employees in Hong Kong, North America, Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries.
Defined benefit plansA defined benefit plan is a pension plan that is not a defined contribution plan. Typically defined benefit plans define an amount of benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position in respect of the defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets. The present value of the defined benefit obligations are calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method, by discounting the estimated future benefits that employees have earned in return for their services in the current and prior periods, using market yields of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligations. For a currency that has no deep market in such high quality corporate bonds, the market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds denominated in that currency shall be used.
The current service cost of the defined benefit plans recognised as employee benefit expense in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, except where included in the cost of an asset, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligations resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements.
The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
Remeasurements arising from defined benefit plans are recognised in other comprehensive income and reflected immediately in retained earnings. Remeasurements comprise actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability/asset.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.
The Group¡¯s defined benefit plans cover eligible employees in Hong Kong and Malaysia.
The defined benefit plan for the Group¡¯s employees in Hong Kong is funded by means of an independent pension fund. The liability recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position in respect of the defined benefit plan is the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the end of each reporting period less the fair value of the plan assets. Defined benefit obligations are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future benefits that employees have earned in return for their services in the current and prior periods by reference to market yields of Hong Kong Government¡¯s Exchange Fund Notes and Government Bonds, which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension obligations.
The defined benefit plan for the Group¡¯s employees in Malaysia is not funded. The Group¡¯s obligation under the plan, calculated using the projected unit credit method, is determined based on actuarial computations by independent actuaries, through which the amount of benefit that the employees have earned in return for their services in the current and prior years is estimated. The benefit is discounted based on the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds in order to determine its present value.
Profit sharing and bonus plansThe expected cost of profit sharing and bonus plans is recognised as a liability when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of services rendered by the employees and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. Liabilities for profit sharing and bonus plans are expected to be settled within 12 months of the end of each reporting period and are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when they are settled.
Employee leave entitlementsEmployee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to the employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by the employees up to the end of each reporting period.
Employee entitlements to sick leave and maternity leave are not recognised until the time of leave.
Long service payments and severance paymentsThe Group¡¯s net obligation in respect of long service payments and severance payments to its employees in Hong Kong upon cessation of their employment in certain circumstances under the Hong Kong Employment Ordinance is the amount of benefits that the employees have earned in return for their services in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method, discounted to its present value and reduced by entitlements accrued under the Group¡¯s retirement schemes that are attributed to contributions made by the Group. The discount rate is the yield at the end of each reporting period of Hong Kong Government¡¯s Exchange Fund Notes and Government Bonds, which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related obligations. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit plans. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.
MEDIA CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED MALAYSIA COMPANY NO. 995098-A
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
Financial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due, in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument. Such financial guarantees are given to banks, financial institutions and other bodies on behalf of subsidiaries or associates to secure loans, overdrafts and other banking facilities.
The Group does not recognise liabilities for financial guarantees at inception, but performs a liability adequacy test at each reporting date by comparing the carrying amount of the net liability regarding the financial guarantee with its present legal or constructive obligation amount. If the carrying amount of the net liability is less than its present legal or constructive obligation amount, the entire difference is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss immediately as an expense.
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group¡¯s activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, business tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group. The Group recognises revenue when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group¡¯s activities as described below. The Group bases its estimates on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.
Revenue is recognised when or as the control of goods or services is transferred to a customer. Depending on the terms of the contract and the laws that apply to the contract, control of the goods and services may be transferred over time or at a point in time. Control of the goods and services is transferred over time if the Group¡¯s performance:
provides	all	of	the	benefits	received	and	consumed	simultaneously	by	the	customer;creates	and	enhances	an	asset	that	the	customer	controls	as	the	Group	performs;	ordoes	not	create	an	asset	with	an	alternative	use	to	the	Group	and	the	Group	has	an	enforceable	right	to	payment	for	performance completed to date.
If control of the goods and services transfers over time, revenue is recognised over the period of the contract by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. Otherwise, revenue is recognised at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the goods and services.
Advertising income, net of trade discounts, is recognised over time when the relevant advertisement in newspapers and magazines are published and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.
Revenue from the circulation and subscription sales of newspapers, magazines and books, net of trade discounts and returns, is recognised at a point in time when control of goods transferred to customers, which generally coincides with the date of delivery. Unearned subscription fees received from subscribers are recorded as contract liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.
Revenue for package tours is recognised over time in which the control of services is transferred to the customer because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefit provided by the Group¡¯s performance as it performs. Payment is made to the Group before the customers enjoy the tour services.
Revenue from the provision of ancillary travel related products and services, sales of air tickets, hotel accommodation and hotel packages is recognised at a point in time when the booking services or tickets are delivered to and have been accepted by the customers. The Group is the agent in these transactions and the revenue is recognised on a net basis.
Revenue from scrap sales of old newspapers and magazines is recognised at a point in time on the date of delivery.
Licence fees and royalty income are recognised on an accrual basis in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements.
Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset except for financial assets that subsequently become credit-impaired. For credit-impaired financial assets the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial assets after deduction of the loss allowance.
Management fee income is recognised on an accrual basis or a straight-line basis over the management service period.
Operating lease rental income is recognised in equal instalments over the periods covered by the lease term.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
MEDIA CHINESE INTERNATIONAL LIMITED MALAYSIA COMPANY NO. 995098-A
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the commencement of leases at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in current and non-current liabilities. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the consolidated statement of profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under a finance lease is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Dividend distributions to owners of the Company are recognised as a liability in the Group¡¯s and the Company¡¯s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are declared by the directors in the case of interim and special dividends or approved by the Company¡¯s shareholders in the case of final dividends.
The Group¡¯s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including price risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group¡¯s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group¡¯s financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the management according to the policies of the Group. The Group¡¯s management identifies and evaluates financial risks in close co-operation with the Group¡¯s operating units.
Price riskThe Group is exposed to price risk for its listed equity securities and unlisted club debentures which are classified on the consolidated statement of financial position as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. Management adopts the quoted market prices as its best estimate of the fair values of such securities and unlisted club debentures. Details are set out in Notes 13 and 21. Management monitors the market conditions and securities price fluctuations so as to minimise adverse effects on the Group.
a Market risk ContinuedInterest rate riskThe Group¡¯s cash balances are placed with authorised financial institutions, which generate interest income for the Group. They are exposed to the cash flow interest rate risk. The Group manages this risk by placing deposits at various maturities and interest rate terms.
The Group¡¯s bank borrowings are exposed to risk arising from changing interest rates. Bank borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group manages this risk by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings.
To evaluate the sensitivity of the Group¡¯s profit before income tax to possible changes in interest rates, the impact of an interest rate change was modeled on the floating rate of bank borrowings while all other variables were held constant. Based on these assumptions, a hypothetical increase of 1% per annum in interest rates would have increased the Group¡¯s loss before income tax for the year ended 31 March 2019 by approximately US$199,000 2018: approximately US$102,000.
Foreign exchange riskThe Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to RM, Canadian dollars ¡°CAD¡±, Hong Kong dollars ¡°HK$¡± and US$. Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations. At 31 March 2019, if US$ had weakened/strengthened by 5% against RM with all other variables held constant, other comprehensive income for the year would have been approximately US$7,524,000 higher/lower, as a result of the foreign exchange difference on translation of RM denominated assets and liabilities.
The assets and liabilities of each entity within the Group are mostly denominated in its own functional currency and do not have material currency impact on the consolidated statement of profit or loss for the year.
For operations in Malaysia, most of the transactions are denominated in RM. The Group had purchased forward contracts during the year ended 31 March 2019 for hedging purposes. The Group is closely monitoring the currency exchange risk of RM and is looking for any opportunities to mitigate the currency exchange risk of RM.
For operations in Canada, most of the transactions are denominated in CAD. No financial instruments were used for hedging purposes during the year. The Group is closely monitoring the currency exchange risk of CAD and will consider the use of financial instrument for hedging purposes, if necessary.
For operations in Hong Kong, most of the transactions are denominated in HK$ and US$. The exchange rate of US$ against HK$ is relatively stable and the related currency exchange risk is considered minimal.

Credit riskCredit risk is the risk of a loss resulting from the failure of one of the Group¡¯s counterparties to discharge its contractual obligations. The Group manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it is willing to accept for individual counterparties and by monitoring exposures in relation to such limits.
The Group applies the simplified approach to provide for expected credit losses prescribed by IFRS 9, which permits the use of the lifetime expected credit loss provision for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. The Group has performed historical analysis and identified the key economic variables impacting credit risk and expected credit loss. It considers available reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information. The Group makes periodic assessments on the recoverability of the receivables based on the background and reputation of the customers, historical settlement records, past experience and available, reasonable and supportive forwarding-looking information.
The provision for loss allowance is based on the payment profiles of trade receivables, trade receivable ageing and geographical locations, ranged from 0.1% to 58.7%.
The credit quality of the other receivables has been assessed with reference to historical information about the counterparties default rates and financial position of the counterparties. The directors are of the opinion that the credit risk of other receivables is low due to the sound collection history of the receivables due from them. Therefore, expected credit loss rate of the other receivables is assessed to be immaterial.
The Group maintains cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank_deposits with reputable financial institutions from which management believes the risk of loss to be remote. The management assesses the credit quality of outstanding cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank_deposits balances as high and considers there is no individually significant exposure. Maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying amount of the cash at banks.
Liquidity riskThe liquidity risk of the Group is controlled by maintaining sufficient banking facilities and cash and cash equivalents, which are generated from the operating cash flows.
The table below analyses the Group¡¯s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the end of each reporting period to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.

The Group¡¯s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group¡¯s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, repurchase shares, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt over owners¡¯ equity. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less short-term bank_deposits and cash and cash equivalents. Owners¡¯ equity represents equity attributable to owners of the Company as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position.
During the year ended 31 March 2019, the Group¡¯s strategy was to maintain a net gearing ratio below 40% 2018: below 40%.
As at 31 March 2019, the Group¡¯s total amount of bank and other borrowings were less than cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank deposits, net gearing ratio was nil 2018: same.
For financial instruments that are measured at fair value, the Group classifies fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that prioritises the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy has the following levels:
¨C Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.¨C
Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices.Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the end of each reporting period. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm¡¯s length basis. The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in level 1.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on the entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to determine the fair value of an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
There was no transfer between level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the year. There was no change during the year attributable to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Group makes estimates and judgements concerning the future based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of each reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwillThe Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in Note 2.9a. The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations require the use of estimates. Changing the assumptions selected by the Group to determine the level, if any, of impairment, including the discount rate or the growth rate assumptions, could significantly affect the Group¡¯s reported financial position and results of operations. The key assumptions used are set out in Note 19.
Income taxesThe Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
Management has considered future taxable income and on-going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the recognition criteria for deferred income tax assets recorded in relation to cumulative tax loss carried forwards. The assumptions regarding future profitability of various subsidiaries and agreed tax losses with the tax authorities require significant judgement, and significant changes in these assumptions from period to period may have a material impact on the Group¡¯s reported financial condition and results of operations.
Investment properties are stated at fair values which have been determined by accredited independent valuers. The best evidence of fair value is current prices in active market for the properties with similar lease and other contracts. In the absence of such information, the Group determines the amount within a range of reasonable fair value estimates. Details of the judgements and assumptions are disclosed in Note 18.
The Group¡¯s management determines the estimated useful lives and related depreciation for its property, plant and equipment. These estimates are based on the historical experience of the actual useful lives of the property, plant and equipment of similar nature and functions. Management will revise the depreciation charge where useful lives are different from those previously estimated. It will also write off or write down non-strategic assets that have been abandoned or sold.
The Group Executive Committee is the Group¡¯s chief operating decision-maker. Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports that are reviewed and used by the Group Executive Committee for strategic decisions making.
Publishing and printing segments are engaged in the publication, printing and distribution of newspapers, magazines, books and digital contents primarily in the Chinese language. The segments derive revenue mainly from the provision of advertising services and sales of newspapers and magazines. Travel and travel related services segment derives revenue from the sales of travel packages and provision of tour services.
The Group Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of segment profit before income tax as presented in the internal financial report. Other information provided is measured in a manner consistent with that in the internal financial report.

Valuation processes and techniquesIndependent valuations were performed by Raine & Horne International Zaki + Partners Sdn Bhd and Betsy Mak Appraisal Group LLC to determine the fair values of the Group¡¯s investment properties as at 31 March 2019 and 2018. The revaluation gains or losses were included in ¡®Other gains, net¡¯ in the consolidated statement of profit or loss Note 7.
For the properties in Malaysia, fair values of investment properties have been generally determined using the sales comparison approach. Sales prices of comparable properties in close proximity are adjusted for differences in key attributes such as property size. The most significant input into this valuation approach is price per square foot.
For the property in the USA, the valuation was determined using income capitalisation approach and sales comparison approach based on significant unobservable inputs. These inputs included:
the valuation date.
There are inter-relationships between unobservable inputs. Estimated vacancy rates may impact the yield, with higher vacancy rates resulting in lower yields. An increase in future rental income may be linked with higher expenses. If the remaining lease term increases, the yield may decrease.

Goodwill acquired through business combination is allocated to cash-generating units ¡°CGUs¡± for impairment testing. The allocation is made to those CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
506,667,259 ordinary shares of HK$0.1 each were deemed to have been issued on 31 March 2008 for the acquisition of certain equity interest in Sin Chew Media Corporation Berhad ¡°SCMC¡± from its non-controlling shareholders. The purchase resulted in the Company recording a goodwill of US$49,018,000 as at 31 March 2008.
The recoverable amount of the SCMC CGU has been determined based on the income approach and discounted cash flow projections approved by management covering a five-year period. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated without any growth rate. Management determined budgeted gross margin based on past performance and the Group¡¯s business plan. The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the CGU. Based on management¡¯s assessment, the recoverable amount determined based on the fair value less cost of disposal calculation was lower than that based on the value-in-use calculation.
The recoverable amount of the SCMC CGU calculated based on the value-in-use calculation was approximately US$57,346,000, which was lower than the carrying amount of the CGU by approximately US$14,551,000. This was primarily attributable to weak advertising sentiments and more cautious spending by the advertisers. Management assessed that changes in key assumptions and estimates would have significant impact on the recoverable amount calculated. Hence, management further provided a provision for impairment of US$14,748,000 2018: US$20,709,000.
Mastheads represented the printing rights of certain publications owned by the Group. During the year, management considered that as some publications have been loss-making and the relevant operations were either terminated during the year or planned to be terminated in the foreseeable future, so the recoverable amount of the related mastheads with carrying value of US$476,000 were determined to be nil. As a result, a provision for impairment amounted to US$476,000 2018: US$949,000 was recognised.
